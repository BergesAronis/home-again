I wake up stiffly in a bed I don't recognize.
I'm all alone. But I don't remember coming here.

I can't walk that far without my cane.
NO CANE: Find your cane.

The floor is cold under my feet. I shouldn't leave this rug without my slippers.
NO SLIPPERS: Find your slippers.

There's a note on the door. I can't read it without my glasses.
NO GLASSES: Find your glasses.
GLASSES: Morgan, Don't wander off again. Do remember to eat. Be nice to your brother. --Charlotte

I won't leave the warmth of this room without my sweater.
NO SWEATER: Find your sweater.

I find a piece of paper on the table. There's a note written on it.
NO GLASSES: I can't quite make out the writing.
GLASSES: I left a container of fruit slices in the fridge. You're welcome to it. --Leon

NO GOAL: What do I need a pair of glasses for?
GOAL: I put on my glasses. I should be able to read now.

NO GOAL: It's plenty warm in here. I don't need my sweater.
GOAL: I put on my sweater. This should keep me warm.

NO GOAL: I'm not going anywhere. No use dragging my cane around.
GOAL: I grip my cane. This should help me get around.

NO GOAL: This rug is quite comfortable, I shouldn't be needing my slippers.
GOAL: I put on my slippers. The floor shouldn't bother me any longer.

Looks like a strange wooden doll. I know it's mine.
It feels very important to me.
...I don't remember why.
Remember the doll.
