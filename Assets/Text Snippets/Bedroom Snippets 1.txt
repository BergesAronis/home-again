You wake up stiffly in a bed you don't recognize.
You're all alone. But you don't remember coming here.

You can't walk that far without your cane.
NO CANE: Find your cane.

The floor is cold under your feet. You shouldn't leave this rug without your slippers.
NO SLIPPERS: Find your slippers.

There's a note on the door. You can't read it without your glasses.
NO GLASSES: Find your glasses.
GLASSES: Don't wander off again. Do remember to eat. Be nice to your brother. --Charlotte

You won't leave the warmth of this room without your sweater.
NO SWEATER: Find your sweater.

You find a piece of paper on the table. There's a note written on it.
NO GLASSES: You can't quite make out the writing.
GLASSES: I left a container of fruit slices in the fridge. You're welcome to it. --Leon

NO GOAL: What do you need a pair of glasses for?
GOAL: You put on your glasses. You should be able to read now.

NO GOAL: It's plenty warm in here. You don't need your sweater.
GOAL: You put on your sweater. This should keep you warm.

NO GOAL: You're not going anywhere. No use dragging your cane around.
GOAL: You grip your cane. This should help you get around.

NO GOAL: This rug is quite comfortable, you shouldn't be needing your slippers.
GOAL: You put on your sweaters. The floor shouldn't bother you any longer.
